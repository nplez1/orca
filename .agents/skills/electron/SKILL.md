description: Launch, automate, and validate Electron desktop apps using playwright-cli via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Use this skill to validate UI changes in Orca, test features in the running Electron app, verify code fixes work end-to-end, or automate any Electron app (VS Code, Slack, Discord, etc.). Triggers include "validate in Electron", "test in the app", "verify the fix", "check the UI", "/electron", "automate Slack app", "control VS Code", or any task requiring interaction with a running Electron application.

# Electron App Automation

Automate any Electron desktop app using playwright-cli's CDP attach mode. Electron apps are built on Chromium and expose a Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) port that playwright-cli can connect to, enabling the same snapshot-interact workflow used for web pages.

## Critical Safety Rule: Never Kill Processes You Didn't Start

**You may be running inside an Electron app (e.g., Orca).** Killing the wrong process will terminate your own session.

- **NEVER** run `killall Electron`, `pkill Electron`, or any broad process-killing command.
- **NEVER** kill a process unless you launched it yourself in this session and you recorded its PID.
- Before killing, **always verify** the PID belongs to the process you started — check the command line includes the workspace path or args you used to launch it.
- When quitting apps to relaunch with `--remote-debugging-port`, use `osascript -e 'quit app "AppName"'` for named apps (Slack, VS Code, etc.) — **never for Orca or the app you're running inside**.
- If unsure whether a process is safe to kill, **ask the user**.

## Core Workflow

1. **Launch** the Electron app with remote debugging enabled (or find an already-running app with CDP)
2. **Attach** playwright-cli to the CDP endpoint
3. **Snapshot** to discover interactive elements
4. **Interact** using element refs
5. **Re-snapshot** after navigation or state changes

```bash
# Launch an Electron app with remote debugging
open -a "Slack" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222

# Wait for the app to initialize
sleep 3

# Attach playwright-cli to the app via CDP
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"

# Standard workflow from here
command playwright-cli snapshot
command playwright-cli click e5
command playwright-cli screenshot
```

## Always prefix with `command`

Use `command playwright-cli …` to bypass shell aliases (e.g. `alias playwright-cli='playwright-cli --persistent'`) that leak flags into subcommands. Behaves identically when no alias is set. All examples below use this form.

## Pick a free CDP port

Port 9333 is a convention, not a guarantee — another worktree may hold it, and electron-vite will start without a debugger, letting you silently attach to the old app.

```bash
for p in 9333 9334 9335 9336 9337 9338 9339 9340; do
  if ! lsof -i :$p >/dev/null 2>&1; then PORT=$p; break; fi
done
# After attach, verify you hit the right worktree:
command playwright-cli eval "window.__store.getState().worktreesByRepo"
```

## Launching Orca Dev Build with CDP

Orca uses electron-vite for dev builds. The correct way to launch with CDP:

```bash
# Launch with remote debugging (PORT picked above)
# ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 is REQUIRED for agent launches (see the repo AGENTS.md):
# never steal monitor focus or reveal test windows, and capture CDP screenshots
# of the hidden renderer instead of calling show()/bringToFront()/app.focus().
ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1 node config/scripts/run-electron-vite-dev.mjs --remote-debugging-port=$PORT 2>&1 &

# Wait for "DevTools listening on ws://..." in output, then attach
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:$PORT"
```

**Key details:**
- Pass `--remote-debugging-port=NNNN` directly to the script — do NOT use `pnpm run dev -- --` (the double `--` breaks Chromium flag parsing)
- electron-vite also supports `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT` env var: `REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=$PORT pnpm run dev`
- The Zustand store is exposed at `window.__store` — use `window.__store.getState()` and `window.__store.getState().someAction()` to read/mutate state
- Use port 9333 (not 9222) to avoid conflicts with other Electron apps

### Accessing Orca State via eval

```bash
# Read store state
command playwright-cli eval "(() => { const s = window.__store?.getState(); return JSON.stringify({ activeWorktreeId: s.activeWorktreeId, activeTabId: s.activeTabId, activeFileId: s.activeFileId, activeTabType: s.activeTabType }); })()"

# Open an editor file
command playwright-cli eval "(() => { const s = window.__store?.getState(); const wtId = s.activeWorktreeId; s.openFile({ worktreeId: wtId, filePath: '/path/to/file', relativePath: 'file.ts', mode: 'edit', language: 'typescript' }); return 'done'; })()"

# Close a file
command playwright-cli eval "(() => { window.__store.getState().closeFile('/path/to/file'); return 'closed'; })()"
```

## Launching Electron Apps with CDP

Every Electron app supports the `--remote-debugging-port` flag since it's built into Chromium.

### macOS

```bash
# Slack
open -a "Slack" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222

# VS Code
open -a "Visual Studio Code" --args --remote-debugging-port=9223

# Discord
open -a "Discord" --args --remote-debugging-port=9224

# Figma
open -a "Figma" --args --remote-debugging-port=9225

# Notion
open -a "Notion" --args --remote-debugging-port=9226

# Spotify
open -a "Spotify" --args --remote-debugging-port=9227
```

### Linux

```bash
slack --remote-debugging-port=9222
code --remote-debugging-port=9223
discord --remote-debugging-port=9224
```

### Windows

```bash
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\slack\slack.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9222
"C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe" --remote-debugging-port=9223
```

**Important:** If the app is already running, quit it first, then relaunch with the flag. The `--remote-debugging-port` flag must be present at launch time.

## Connecting to an Already-Running App

If an Electron app was already launched with `--remote-debugging-port`, you can attach directly:

```bash
# Check what's listening on a port
lsof -i :9222

# Verify the CDP endpoint has targets
curl -s http://localhost:9222/json

# Attach playwright-cli
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"
```

## Attaching

```bash
# Attach to a specific CDP port
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"

# Attach with a named session (for controlling multiple apps)
command playwright-cli -s=slack attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"
command playwright-cli -s=vscode attach --cdp="http://localhost:9223"
```

After `attach`, all subsequent commands (in that session) target the connected app.

## Tab Management

Electron apps may have multiple windows or webviews. Use tab commands to list and switch between them:

```bash
# List all available targets
command playwright-cli tab-list

# Switch to a specific tab by index
command playwright-cli tab-select 2
```

If `tab-list` doesn't show all targets, query the CDP endpoint directly to see everything:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9222/json | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for i, t in enumerate(json.load(sys.stdin)):
    print(f'[{i}] ({t[\"type\"]}) {t[\"title\"][:60]} - {t[\"url\"][:60]}')
"
```

## Common Patterns

### Inspect and Navigate an App

```bash
open -a "Slack" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222
sleep 3
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"
command playwright-cli snapshot
# Read the snapshot output to identify UI elements
command playwright-cli click e10   # Navigate to a section
command playwright-cli snapshot    # Re-snapshot after navigation
```

### Take Screenshots of Desktop Apps

```bash
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"
command playwright-cli screenshot
command playwright-cli screenshot e5  # Screenshot a specific element
command playwright-cli screenshot --filename=app-state.png
```

### Extract Data from a Desktop App

```bash
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"
command playwright-cli snapshot
command playwright-cli eval "document.title"
command playwright-cli eval "el => el.textContent" e5
```

### Fill Forms in Desktop Apps

```bash
command playwright-cli attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"
command playwright-cli snapshot
command playwright-cli fill e3 "search query"
command playwright-cli press Enter
command playwright-cli snapshot
```

### Run Multiple Apps Simultaneously

Use named sessions to control multiple Electron apps at the same time:

```bash
# Attach to Slack
command playwright-cli -s=slack attach --cdp="http://localhost:9222"

# Attach to VS Code
command playwright-cli -s=vscode attach --cdp="http://localhost:9223"

# Interact with each independently
command playwright-cli -s=slack snapshot
command playwright-cli -s=vscode snapshot
```

### Run Custom Playwright Code

For advanced scenarios, use `run-code` to execute arbitrary Playwright code:

```bash
command playwright-cli run-code "async page => {
  await page.waitForSelector('.loading', { state: 'hidden' });
  const items = await page.locator('.item').allTextContents();
  return items;
}"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Connection refused" or "Cannot connect"

- Make sure the app was launched with `--remote-debugging-port=NNNN`
- If the app was already running, quit and relaunch with the flag
- Check that the port isn't in use by another process: `lsof -i :9222`

### App launches but attach fails

- Wait a few seconds after launch before attaching (`sleep 3`)
- Some apps take time to initialize their webview
- Verify the endpoint is responding: `curl -s http://localhost:9222/json`

### Elements not appearing in snapshot

- The app may use multiple webviews. Use `playwright-cli tab-list` to list targets and switch
- Use `curl -s http://localhost:<port>/json` to see all CDP targets if tab-list shows fewer
- Try `playwright-cli snapshot` without flags first

### Cannot type in input fields

- Some Electron apps use custom input components
- Try `playwright-cli press` for keyboard events
- Use `playwright-cli run-code` for complex input scenarios

### Stale element refs after interaction

- Element refs change when the page state updates
- Always re-snapshot after clicking, navigating, or filling forms
- Use the new refs from the latest snapshot

## Supported Apps

Any app built on Electron works, including:

- **Communication:** Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Signal, Telegram Desktop
- **Development:** VS Code, GitHub Desktop, Postman, Insomnia
- **Design:** Figma, Notion, Obsidian
- **Media:** Spotify, Tidal
- **Productivity:** Todoist, Linear, 1Password

If an app is built with Electron, it supports `--remote-debugging-port` and can be automated with playwright-cli.

## Cleaning Up

```bash
# Close the playwright-cli session (does NOT kill the Electron app)
command playwright-cli close

# Close a named session
command playwright-cli -s=slack close

# Close all playwright-cli sessions
command playwright-cli close-all
```
